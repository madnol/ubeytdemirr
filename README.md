# Hi ! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

I am a **Fullstack JavaScript Developer**, that focuses on MERN stack.

I have a strong understanding of Javascript/Typescript HTML5, and CSS3.

I am using the React framework to build beautiful web applications. I am following Design Systems as well as Web Accessibility and Semantic Web Designing while I code. 

I can create and maintain REST and GraphQL APIs with Node.js, using NoSQL Databases such as MongoDB or Relational Databases such as PostgreSQL. 

I use serverless and cloud technologies such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure to empower my backend skills.
